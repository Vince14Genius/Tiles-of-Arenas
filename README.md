# Tiles-of-Arenas
A simple tile-based multiplayer strategy game created with the p5.js library

## Description
An offline multiplayer strategy board game written in JavaScript. For each turn, each player occupies a fixed number of additional adjacent tiles, and picks one tile in their possession to discard. The players expand their territories to collect resources and conquer enemy territories. Resources give players either additional tile occupation per turn, the ability to fortify tiles to defend from enemy invasion, or special abilities such as tile leaping or forced occupation. Obstacle tiles exist on the map and are only vulnerable to forced occupation.

## To-do List (short-term)
* Add respawn mechanism so that the game doesn't get stuck after a player has been eliminated
* Add the end-game objective
* Add spawning mechanism for consumable resources
* Remove the "fortify" tile, move the ability to fortify occupied tiles to each player's turn as an alternative to occupying nearby tiles

## To-do List (long-term)
* Add an online multiplayer mode
